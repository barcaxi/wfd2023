# Leaflet Exercise 1

## Clone the Remote Repository

This will copy some ``leaflet`` code files to your ``htdocs`` folder.  

Go to [this link](https://github.com/barcaxi/wfd2023) and download the repository ZIP file.  Copy the folder ``leaflet`` into your XAMPP ``htdocs`` folder.

Check your ``htdocs`` folder.  You should have a new folder called ``leaflet`` with some files in it.


## Hello Leaflet 

1.	Open and examine the file [http://localhost/leaflet/HelloLeaflet.html](http://localhost/leaflet/HelloLeaflet.html)

1.	Using your code editor change the map center coordinates to your home or a well known location.  Experiment with the zoom too.

1.	We should always try to keep JavaScript code in separate `.js` files.  Provide the code in `HelloLeafletV2.html` and `HelloLeafletV2.js` so the mapping functions are stored only in the `HelloLeafletV2.js` file.  Use jQuery in you solution.  When done the link [here](http://localhost/Leaflet/HelloLeafletV2.html) will work.


## Big 5

1.	Open and examine the file [http://localhost/leaflet/Big5.html](http://localhost/leaflet/Big5.html).  Provide the code to implement the solution shown [here](images/Big5.gif)

	Keep the `.js` and `.html` code separate.
